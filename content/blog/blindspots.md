Even though I know I know I don't know a lot of things, life still regularly
surprises me. While I get weird out on finding out how wrong my perspective on
something is, it is also oddly satisfying. Such surprises (shocks in some cases)
yield a new lens. What I can't stop wondering is the opportunity cost involved.
My current hypothesis is that some of these findings cost quite a bit and these
findings by themselves cannot repay the cost involved. The trick lies in playing
the curiosity game to use the lenses to find better ones. And as in physics,
combining these lenses leads to a much higher return.
