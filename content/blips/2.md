I'm experience a management style that I call 'Always Be Fire Fighting'. ABFF.
The manager believes that there will always
be things on fire and his job is to put out fires as they come up.
As long as all fires are under control, everything is good.
And no, this managere is not in-charge of a fire station.

The engineer in me says this is inefficient and we can improve.
But since this thought itself is not currently a fire, this is going to be
ignored. You see the trap?
